## JVM-based clients configuration

Copy your configuration from UI of ReportPortal at User Profile section

or

In order to start using an agent, user should configure property file
"reportportal.properties" in such format:

**reportportal.properties**

```properties
rp.endpoint = https://rp.epam.com/
rp.api.key = 8967de3b-fec7-47bb-9dbc-2aa4ceab8b1e
rp.launch = launch-name
rp.project = project-name

## OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
rp.reporting.async = true
rp.reporting.callback = true
rp.enable = true
rp.description = My awesome launch
rp.attributes = key:value;value
rp.rerun = true
rp.rerun.of = ae586912-841c-48de-9391-50720c35dd5a
rp.convertimage = true
rp.mode = DEFAULT
rp.skipped.issue = true
rp.batch.size.logs = 20
rp.keystore.resource = <PATH_TO_YOUR_KEYSTORE>
rp.keystore.password = <PASSWORD_OF_YOUR_KEYSTORE>
```


**Parameters**

User should provide next parameters to agent.

| **Parameter**                                 | **Description**      | **Required**|
|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------|-------------|
|rp.endpoint                                    |URL of web service, where requests should be send |Yes |
|rp.api.key or rp.uuid                          |Api token of user |Yes |
|rp.launch                                      |The unique name of Launch (Run). Based on that name a history of runs will be created for particular name |Yes |
|rp.project                                     |Project name to identify scope |Yes |
|rp.enable                                      |Enable/Disable logging to Report Portal: rp.enable=true - enable log to RP server.  Any other value means 'false': rp.enable=false - disable log to RP server.  If parameter is absent in  properties file then automation project results will be posted on RP. |No |
|rp.description                                 |Launch description |No |
|rp.attributes                                  |Set of attributes for specifying additional meta information for current launch. Format: key:value;value;build:12345-6. Attributes should be separated by “;”, keys and values - “:”. |No |
|rp.reporting.async                             |Enables asynchronous reporting. Available values - `true` or `false`(by default). Supported only in 5+ vesion |No |
|rp.reporting.callback                          |Enables [callback reporting](https://github.com/reportportal/client-java/wiki/Callback-reporting-usefulness). Available values - `true` or `false`(by default). Supported only in 5+ vesion |No |
|rp.rerun                                       |Enables [rerun mode](https://github.com/reportportal/documentation/blob/master/src/md/src/DevGuides/rerun.md). Available values - `true` or `false`(by default). Supported only in 5+ version | No |
|rp.rerun.of                                    |Specifies UUID of launch that has to be reruned |No |
|rp.convertimage                                |Colored log images can be converted to grayscale for reducing image size. Values: ‘true’ – will be converted. Any other value means ‘false’. |No |
|rp.mode                                        |ReportPortal provides possibility to specify visibility of executing launch. Currently two modes are supported: DEFAULT  - all users from project can see this launch; DEBUG - all users except of Customer role can see this launch (in debug sub tab). Note: for all java based clients (TestNG, Junit) mode will be set automatically to "DEFAULT" if it is not specified. |No |
|rp.skipped.issue                               |ReportPortal provides feature to mark skipped tests as not 'To Investigate' items on WS side. Parameter could be equal boolean values: *TRUE* - skipped tests considered as issues and will be marked as 'To Investigate' on Report Portal. *FALSE* - skipped tests will not be marked as 'To Investigate' on application. |No |
|rp.batch.size.logs                             |In order to rise up performance and reduce number of requests to server. Default = 10 |No |
|rp.keystore.resource                           |Put your JKS file into resources and specify path to it | No|
|rp.keystore.password                           |Access password for JKS (certificate storage) package, mentioned above |No |

Launch name can be edited once, and should be edited once, before first
execution. As usual, parts of launches are fixed for a long time. Keeping the
same name for launch, here we will understand a fixed list of suites under
launch, will help to have a history trend, and on UI instances of the same
launch will be saved with postfix "\#number", like "Test Launch \#1", "Test
Launch \#2" etc.

>   If mandatory properties are missed client throw exception
>   IllegalArgumentException.

**Proxy configuration**

For clients using a standard java proxy mechanism. New to Java scripting? try [Java networking and proxies](<http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/net/proxies.html>) page.

Ways to set up properties:

a. reportportal.properties file

b. command line properties (-Dhttps.proxyHost=localhost)

**How to provide parameters**

There are several ways to load parameters. Be aware that higher order overrides previous. 
For example, properties from file can be overridden by JVM variables

| Order | Source
|-------| ----------------------|
| 1     | Environment variables |
| 2     | JVM variables         |
| 3     | Properties file       |


Properties file should have name 

> reportportal.properties
>

It can be situated on the class path (in the project directory). 
If listener can’t find properties file it throws FileNotFoundException. 
By default “reportportal.properties” exists in the reportportall-client.jar, 
but user can create his own “reportportal.properties” file and put in class path.
